# Abstract
This investigation probes the intricate interplay of catalyst dynamics and reaction pathways during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), highlighting the significance of atomic-level and local ligand structure insights in crafting highly active electrocatalysts. Leveraging a tailored ion exchange reaction followed by electrochemical dynamic reconstruction, we engineered a novel catalytic structure featuring single Ir atoms anchored to NiOOH (Ir<sub>1</sub>@NiOOH). This novel approach involved the strategic replacement of Fe with Ir, facilitating the transition of selenide precatalysts into active (oxy)hydroxides. This elemental substitution promoted an upward shift in the O 2p band and intensified the metal–oxygen covalency, thereby altering the OER mechanism toward enhanced activity. The shift from a single-metal site mechanism (SMSM) in NiOOH to a dual-metal-site mechanism (DMSM) in Ir<sub>1</sub>@NiOOH was substantiated by in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and supported by theoretical insights. Remarkably, the Ir<sub>1</sub>@NiOOH electrode exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic performance, achieving overpotentials as low as 142 and 308 mV at current densities of 10 and 1000 mA cm<sup>–2</sup>, respectively, setting a new benchmark for the electrocatalysis of OER.
