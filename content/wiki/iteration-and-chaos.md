# Iterative methods for computing physical quantities

If a physical quantity is involved in the expression of itself :
$$
f(x)=x \tag{1-1}
$$
Iterative methods are usually employed for solving it.

## Direct iterative method

Let $f(x_n)=x_{n+1}$ï¼Œcompute from a preset $x_0$ until $x_n=x_{n+1}$.

Considering the limited iterative steps in real world, a strict equation is hard to get. Usually, a convergence factor $\epsilon$ is used for qualification:

$$
\bigg | \frac{x_{n+1}-x_n}{x_n} \bigg | \leq \epsilon
$$
## Newton iterative method
