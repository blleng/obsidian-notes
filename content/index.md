Everything begins to look around.
We walk in the sun in hundreds.

Each man is a half-open door
leading to a room for everyone.

Tomas Tranströmer, **The Half-Finished Heaven**

Welcome to Moontains!
```

**Moontain**, a compound word constructed with "moon" and "mountain". I use it to express a prudent imagination of a place far from the noise and bustle.

This site serves as a digital garden containing musings from me and treasures from others.
It's [open source](https://github.com/blleng/obsidian-notes) for sure. In this garden, notes with maturity levels from "sprout" to "tree" delineate the growth of my thoughts. You can visit this [[maturity/index|maturity-identification]] system for a complete grasp of my garden.

Principally, my garden is divided into 6 parts including **Flashes**, **Notes**, **Readings**, **Open Source**, **Writings**, **Wiki**. The following navigation may act as an invitation into the starting point of your tour in my garden:

| Name                      | Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[flashes\|Flashes]]      | This part contains ideas just flashed through my brain or inspiration from anywhere. These contents can be brief and immature, but they are always the original source of my further works. Contents here should be transformed into practical works for other parts as soon as possible. |
| [[notes\|Notes]]          | Notes are commonly the records of history, conclusion or development of projects or other stuff I've done (or I'm doing). They can be derived from "Flashes" and may be related to my writings or open-source programs.                                                                   |
| [[readings\|Readings]]    | This part is the collection of my readings (e.g. Books, papers, magazines or other materials). Contents here can be the origin of "Flashes" and finally the nutrition of my works.                                                                                                        |
| [[projects\|Open Source]] | This part is the collection of my open-source programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[writings\|Writings]]    | My literature works and output of thoughts are put here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Wiki                      | Here are some learning points and explanations of concepts I've met while reading or at other places. Actually, this part contains my learning materials.                                                                                                                                 |
